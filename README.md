################## How to run the code ###################
##########################################################

**STEP 1: **Download the RScript and all attached files somewhere on your desktop. The code is written in a way that you should be able to run it without having to adjust any file path names.

**STEP 2: **To access the two APIs used throughout this thesis, you will need two API keys:
_2.1)_ Bings Maps API Key: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key#creating-a-bing-maps-key
Make sure to get an Education Key through HSG so their are no request limits.
_2.2) _EventStudyTools API Key: https://www.eventstudytools.com/api-access
The key for this powerful Event Study API is 10.- USD and valid for a month, which is great value for money in my opinion.

**STEP 3:** Adjust the parameters to reproduce the desired outcome from the thesis. E.g., adjust the event windows to your desired model. Spots where adjustments are needed are clearly marked and the necessary adjustments are outlined throughout the code in the following format:
